## 🏃 Human Activity Recognition using LSTM

This project recognizes human activities (walking, running, sitting, etc.) from time-series sensor data using deep learning models, specifically LSTM networks.

### 📂 Dataset
- Wearable sensor data with activity labels.

### 🔍 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Normalization of sensor signals.
   - Segmentation of time-series windows.
2. **Model Training**:
   - LSTM networks for sequential activity recognition.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
   - Confusion matrix visualization.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

### 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook to train and evaluate activity recognition models
